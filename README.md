## Introduction
Tic tac toe by Matt Taylor
The goal of this SPA is to utilize front end design with javascript to create a
re-playable Tic-tac-toe game with a minimalistic but functional UI.
This project serves as a tool for me to individually practice javascript logic
implementation while incorporating API functionality. This project will allow
me to continuously update and experiment as I learn more about front and back
end development.


## development Process

This project started out with a wireframe that the application was loosely
designed for. The User Authentication forms were built in HTML and designed to
connect the form data to the pre-made API. The game board was made to have
clickable tiles that were used as spots for players choices for the game. The
tiles were given IDs to link them with the API indexes created for each
game. This build is currently bare bones but functional with login
authentication as well as necessary game logic to play multiple games without
refreshing the page.

Built with Javascript, css, html5 and Ajax.

## Problem Solving Strategy

My approach to the problems encountered during development were focusing on one
single aspect of each problem at a time. Although slow and tedious it resulted
in functional game logic. The only downside to this was very repetitive code
that could and should be entirely reworked. Moving forward, if any code I write
is as complicated as the game logic I need to incoporate notes to clarify
the goal of each function for any developers who look at my code before I
condense it.

## Planned additions for the future

-Complete rework of inefficient game logic
-Highlight row column or diagonal of winning tiles briefly before resetting game board
Implement different themes that could be switched into by clicking
Multiplayer
-Better statistics that include:
  total moves per player
  Total play time
  Average time per game
  Win ratios of each player
Scalable game board size for mobile and other screen sizes.


## Wireframes and User Stories

as a user i want to be able to log in so that the game will keep track of my score
as a user I want to be able to log out so that other people cannot play on my account
as a user I want to be able to change my password when I want
as a player I want to be able to play on multiple platforms
as a player I want to be able to see statistics based on my play time
as a player I want to be able to play multiple games without refreshing my browser
as a player I want to be able to see how many games I have won and lost
