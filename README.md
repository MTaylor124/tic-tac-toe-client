Tic tac toe by Matt Taylor

The goal of this SPA is to utilize front end design with javascript to create a re-playable Tic-tac-toe game with a minimalistic but functional UI.

as a user i want to be able to log in so that the game will keep track of my score
as a user I want to be able to log out so that other people cannot play on my account
as a user I want to be able to play on multiple platforms
as a user I want to be able to see statistics based on my play time
as a user I want to be able to play multiple games without refreshing my browser


This project serves as a tool for me to individually practice javascript logic implementation while incorporating API functionality. This project will allow me to continuously update and experiment as I learn more about front and back end development.

This build is currently bare bones but functional with login authentication as well as necessary game logic to play multiple games without refreshing the page.


Built with Javascript, css, html5 and Ajax.


Additions planned for the future:

-Complete rework of inefficient game logic
-Highlight row column or diagonal of winning tiles briefly before resetting game board
Implement different themes that could be switched into by clicking
Multiplayer
-Better statistics that include:
  total moves per player
  Total play time
  Average time per game
  Win ratios of each player
Scalable game board size for mobile and other screen sizes.
